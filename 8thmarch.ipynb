    "The Probability Density Function (PDF) is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a particular value or range of values. \n",
    "Specifically, the PDF is a function that maps the possible values of a random variable to the probabilities of observing those values.\n",
    "The PDF is often denoted as f(x), where x is the random variable. The integral of the PDF over a range of values gives the probability of observing the random variable falling within that range.\n",
    "In other words, the PDF represents the distribution of a continuous random variable, which is often visualized as a smooth curve. \n",
    "The area under the curve of the PDF between two values gives the probability of the random variable falling within that range."

    "There are several types of Probability distributions, but the most common are:\n",
    "Normal Distribution: This is also known as the Gaussian distribution or the bell curve. It is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric around the mean, with the majority of observations falling within one standard deviation of the mean.\n",
    "Binomial Distribution: This is a discrete probability distribution that describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, where each trial has the same probability of success.\n",
    "Poisson Distribution: This is a discrete probability distribution that describes the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space. It is often used to model rare events that occur randomly over time or space.\n",
    "Exponential Distribution: This is a continuous probability distribution that describes the time between events that occur randomly and independently of each other. It is often used to model the time between arrivals in a queue or the time until failure of a system.\n",
    "Uniform Distribution: This is a continuous probability distribution where all values within a given interval are equally likely. It is often used to model situations where all outcomes are equally likely, such as rolling a fair dice.\n",
    "Beta Distribution: This is a continuous probability distribution that is commonly used to model the distribution of probabilities, such as the probability of success in a Bernoulli trial.\n",
    "These are just a few examples of the many probability distributions that are used in statistics and probability theory."

Specifically, the least frequent data points are located in the regions that are more than 2 or 3 standard deviations away from the mean.\n",
    "This is because the normal distribution is a symmetric distribution, where the majority of the data is concentrated around the mean and decreases gradually as we move away from the mean towards the tails of the distribution. As a result, the data points in the tails of the distribution are relatively rare and occur with a lower frequency compared to the data points near the mean."
